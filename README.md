# housing-affordability-analysis-r

This project involves an in-depth statistical analysis of a Real Estate dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rooorytaip/real-estate-dataset 
. The dataset consists of property listings and attributes related to housing and real estate markets, which were used to explore relationships between housing characteristics and price indicators for analytical modeling and prediction.

The analysis was conducted entirely in R and started with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, renaming columns for clarity, converting categorical variables to factors, and assessing the overall structure of the dataset. Next, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using summary statistics and visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, and correlation matrices) to understand distributions and relationships among features such as property size, number of bedrooms, location indicators, and price or value variables.

A key part of this project was applying linear regression to model how one or more predictor variables relate to a target outcome, such as property price or value. Linear regression was used to quantify the relationships and assess how well variables like square footage or number of bedrooms explain variation in the response variable. Model performance was evaluated using standard statistics (e.g., R-squared and diagnostic plots), and findings were interpreted with respect to real-world housing dynamics.

Beyond regression, additional statistical tests (e.g., chi-square tests) and probability assessments were performed to reveal deeper insights into how categorical variables (e.g., property type) relate to outcomes of interest. Throughout the project, emphasis was placed on clear documentation and reproducibility of results using R scripts.

Overall, this project demonstrates the end-to-end use of R for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling (including linear regression), and interpretation, using real-world real estate data sourced directly from a Kaggle dataset.
